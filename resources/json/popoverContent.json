For example, a few thousands of SNPs may be sufficient for a typical population structure analysis. Demographic inference using more complex models such as the estimation of migration between population (e.g. Multispecies Coalescent Model with Introgression; Flouri et al. 2020 doi:10.1093/molbev/msz296) may require more."
